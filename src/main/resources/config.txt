Hi all,
Wanted to be an original thought while posting my good bye, but  was unable to control my urge to google the content for “the last day’s email” and was surprised to see the ‘single-sourcing’..  :D

Decided to keep it simple. Here’s bidding adieu and wishing you all the good things life can possibly offer. I have been a part of Cybage for the last 2 years , of which I have enjoyed every single day, right from my first day at induction till date. Tomorrow this journey ends. Honestly, I never expected leaving Cybage to be this hard, but it is. 

I would like to thank all of you who have helped me and supported me directly or indirectly to grow in every dimension, be it technical or musical, in this firm. It has been a truly wonderful and valuable experience with you guys and I’ll cherish each one of them.

Do stay in touch and I hope our paths cross again.
